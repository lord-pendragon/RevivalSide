# DownloadSide

DownloadSide is the legacy Discord front door for RevivalSide release downloads. It keeps Discord and GitHub secrets on the server, verifies a user's Discord guild role, and proxies private GitHub release assets.

RevivalSide v0.3.1 Setup and Launcher do not use DownloadSide. Setup downloads GitHub release assets directly from the manifest URL baked into the setup executable, and Launcher starts the local listener without Discord entitlement checks.

## Local Setup

```powershell
cd download-service
Copy-Item .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev
```

Fill `.env` with a Discord OAuth app, the target guild and role IDs, and either `GITHUB_TOKEN` or GitHub App credentials that can read private release assets from `MadlyMoe/RevivalSide`.

Use these Discord OAuth scopes:

```text
identify guilds.members.read
```

## Routes

- `GET /health`
- `GET /auth/discord/login?deviceCode=...`
- `GET /auth/discord/callback`
- `GET|POST /auth/device/start`
- `GET /auth/device/:deviceCode/status`
- `GET /latest`
- `GET /releases/:tag/manifest`
- `GET /releases/:tag/assets/:assetName`

`/releases/:tag/manifest`, `/releases/:tag/assets/:assetName`, and `/latest` require:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <installToken>
```

## Device Flow

1. Setup starts a device authorization by calling `/auth/device/start`.
2. The browser redirects to Discord OAuth.
3. The callback exchanges the OAuth code server-side.
4. The service calls Discord's current-user guild member endpoint for `DISCORD_GUILD_ID`.
5. The service checks `roles` for `DISCORD_ALLOWED_ROLE_ID`.
6. Setup polls `/auth/device/:deviceCode/status`.
7. On success, the status response returns a short-lived install token.
8. Setup downloads release assets through this service with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
9. Launcher starts the installed local listener directly after Setup completes.

This device flow is not used by RevivalSide v0.3.1 release builds.

## GitHub Assets

The private GitHub release should contain:

```text
RevivalSidePayloadManifest.json
RevivalSidePayload-vX.Y.Z.zip
```

Split payload parts also work as long as the manifest's `chunks[].name` values match the GitHub release asset names.

The service fetches assets from private GitHub releases server-side. Do not put GitHub tokens, Discord client secrets, or GitHub App private keys in Setup or Launcher.

## Deploy DownloadSide

The included `Dockerfile` and `fly.toml` deploy DownloadSide as a single always-on Fly.io Machine at:

```text
https://downloadside.fly.dev
```

The service currently stores pending device auth codes in memory, so run one Machine until that store moves to Redis or another shared backend.

First, log in and create the app:

```powershell
cd C:\Main\Productivity\StopKillingGames\Projects\RevivalSide\download-service
flyctl auth login
flyctl apps create downloadside
```

Add this redirect URL in the Discord Developer Portal:

```text
https://downloadside.fly.dev/auth/discord/callback
```

Then fill `download-service\.env` with the same values you use locally and import Fly runtime secrets from that file. Do not commit `.env`.

```powershell
npm run secrets:fly
```

This reads non-empty DownloadSide deploy variables from `.env` and stages them with `flyctl secrets import --stage`.

Deploy:

```powershell
npm run deploy:fly
```

Smoke test:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod https://downloadside.fly.dev/health
```

## Packaging

Build the v0.3.1 installer with the direct GitHub release URL:

```powershell
npm run publish:github-release -- -ReleaseTag v0.3.1
```

The package script bakes the installer manifest URL as:

```text
https://github.com/MadlyMoe/RevivalSide/releases/download/v0.3.1/RevivalSidePayloadManifest.json
```

When Setup runs, it downloads the manifest and payload assets directly from the GitHub release and validates SHA-256 hashes from `RevivalSidePayloadManifest.json`.

Launcher does not perform Discord entitlement checks. `START` uses the existing `npm run listen` path without prompting for Discord in the launcher process.
